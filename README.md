# Luis Oliveira

Full-stack software engineer based in Brazil.

I work mostly with React and React Native on the frontend, Node.js on the backend. I care about writing maintainable code and shipping things that work.

Good software needs good communication—with the computer and with your team. I care about getting both right.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React, React Native, TypeScript, Redux  
**Backend:** Node.js, NestJS  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL  
**Tools:** Git, Docker
